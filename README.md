# ToDo List Console App
 This is a simple console-based To-Do List application built using Python. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks interactively through a menu-driven interface. Developed as part of my internship with ONLEI Technologies, the project demonstrates core Python concepts such as lists, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
